## How to navigate in the terminal

The terminal is a program that helps you to access files and other programs. You can think of it as "Explorer for Developers".

The very basic: You can run a program by writing it's name. There is a program for everything.

Let's try. There is a program for showing your username. Type `whoami` in the terminal.

Good to know: In documentation there is often a `$` to showcase, that this line of code should be written in the terminal. Example: `$ cd newProject` and you should write in your terminal `cd newProject`.
