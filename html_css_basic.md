## How to get started with HTML and CSS

HTML is THE language of the internet. It is not really a programming language but a way to describe contents.
Imagine your program Word. There you can define headlines, content and images. This is HTML.

CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets. It works together with HTML. While HTML is describing the content, CSS is describing the style. This could be the color or size of the font, the size of an image and more.

HTML and CSS is static. So there are no (ok, there are some but only very little) animations or dynamic elements. This is what you would need JavaScript for.
